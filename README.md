## Bidding System Logic

### How Bidding Works
1. Admin adds a product with a "Total Bids Required" value
2. Users place bids (each bid is a fixed small amount)
3. When total bids reach the required number:
   - The system randomly selects a winner from all bidders
   - The winner receives the product
   - Bidding for that product closes

### Winner Selection Algorithm
- Uses a verifiably random method
- All bidders have equal chance regardless of bid timing
- Winner is logged with timestamp and bid details

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time bidding updates with WebSockets
- Payment integration for bid payments
- Email notifications for winners
- Enhanced admin analytics dashboard
- User wallet/balance system
